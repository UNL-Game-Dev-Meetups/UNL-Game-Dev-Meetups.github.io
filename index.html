            <p>Join us on Sunday, March 14<sup>th</sup> at 7PM as we demo how create various 3D environments in Unity! First we will create and light a forest scene, and then we will create and light an interior dungeon scene.

Please download and install <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">a version of Unity through Unity Hub</a> before the meeting so you can follow along! This meeting will be held on our <a href="https://go.unl.edu/unlgdcdiscord" target="_blank">Discord server</a> in the General voice channel.
