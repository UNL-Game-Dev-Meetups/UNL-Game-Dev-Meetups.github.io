            <h1>Helpful Game Development Resources</h1>
            <p>Many students are often confused on how to get started in game development. Below are some helpful links to get started in using an engine, 3D modeling tools, 2D art tools, open license resources, and more. Everything listed below is free to UNL students for some period of time, such as X years, or free to the public indefinitely.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are options to pay for some parts of these resources (like free vs paid assets) but there is absolutely no requirement to do so.</p>
